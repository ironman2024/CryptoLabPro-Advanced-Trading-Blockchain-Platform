Keeping cryptocurrency offline to protect it from hacking or theft.

### Confirmation
The inclusion of a transaction in a block that has been added to the blockchain, with each subsequent block adding another confirmation.

### Consensus Mechanism
The protocol by which blockchain networks agree on the state of the ledger and validate transactions.

### Cryptocurrency
A digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a blockchain.

## D

### Decentralized Application (DApp)
An application that runs on a decentralized network rather than being hosted on centralized servers.

### Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)
An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.

### Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Financial applications built on blockchain technologies that aim to recreate and improve upon traditional financial systems.

### Difficulty
A measure of how hard it is to mine a new block, adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block time.

### Double Spending
The risk that a digital currency can be spent twice by duplicating or falsifying the transaction.

## E

### ERC-20
A technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens.

### Ethereum
A decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.

### Exchange
A platform where users can buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies.

## F

### Fiat Currency
Government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity like gold but rather by the government that issued it.

### Fork
A split in a blockchain network, creating two separate versions of the blockchain with a shared history. Can be either a hard fork or a soft fork.

### Full Node
A computer that fully validates transactions and blocks in a blockchain network.

## G

### Gas
A unit that measures the computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network.

### Genesis Block
The first block of a blockchain, hardcoded into the protocol.

### Governance
The system by which decisions are made in a blockchain network, often involving voting mechanisms.

## H

### Halving
A scheduled event where the block reward for mining new blocks is cut in half, reducing the rate at which new coins are created.

### Hash
The output of a hash function, which converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters.

### Hash Rate
The computational power being used by a network to solve the cryptographic puzzles required for mining.

## I

### Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
A fundraising mechanism where new projects sell their underlying crypto tokens in exchange for bitcoin or ether.

### Immutable
Cannot be changed or altered. Blockchain records are designed to be immutable.

## K

### KYC (Know Your Customer)
The process of verifying the identity of customers, often required by cryptocurrency exchanges to comply with regulations.

### Key Pair
A set of public and private cryptographic keys used to secure cryptocurrency transactions.

## L

### Layer 2
A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain to improve its scalability and efficiency.

### Lightning Network
A "layer 2" payment protocol that operates on top of a blockchain to enable fast transactions between participating nodes.

### Liquidity Pool
A collection of funds locked in a smart contract, used to facilitate trading by providing liquidity.

## M

### Market Cap
The total value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the price by the circulating supply.

### Merkle Tree
A data structure used in blockchain to efficiently verify the integrity of large data sets.

### Mining
The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain ledger, often rewarded with new cryptocurrency.

### Multisig (Multisignature)
A security feature requiring multiple signatures to authorize a cryptocurrency transaction.

## N

### Node
A computer that connects to a blockchain network and maintains a copy of the blockchain.

### Nonce
A number used once in a cryptographic communication, often used in proof-of-work systems to find a valid block hash.

### NFT (Non-Fungible Token)
A unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item or piece of content on the blockchain.

## O

### Oracle
A service that provides external data to a blockchain or smart contract.

### Open Source
Software whose source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

## P

### Private Key
A secret number that allows cryptocurrency to be spent. Anyone with knowledge of a private key has control over the associated cryptocurrency.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

### Proof of Work (PoW)
A consensus mechanism requiring computational effort to solve complex puzzles, used to validate transactions and create new blocks.

### Public Key
A cryptographic key that can be shared with anyone, used to verify that a message was signed with the corresponding private key.

## R

### Rollup
A scaling solution that performs transaction execution outside the main blockchain but posts transaction data on layer 1.

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
A protocol that allows a program to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network.

## S

### Satoshi
The smallest unit of Bitcoin, equal to 0.00000001 BTC, named after Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.

### Scalability
The ability of a blockchain network to handle an increasing amount of transactions.

### Smart Contract
Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, automatically enforcing and executing agreements.

### Stablecoin
A type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by pegging to a reserve asset like the US dollar.

## T

### Token
A unit of value issued by a tech platform, usually built on top of an existing blockchain.

### Transaction Fee
A fee paid to miners or validators to process a cryptocurrency transaction.

### Trustless
A property of blockchain systems where participants don't need to trust each other or a third party for the system to function correctly.

## U

### UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
An output of a blockchain transaction that has not been spent and can be used as an input in a new transaction.

## V

### Validator
In proof-of-stake systems, a participant who is responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the blockchain.

### Volatility
The degree of variation in trading price over time, often high in cryptocurrency markets.

## W

### Wallet
Software or hardware that stores private keys and allows users to interact with a blockchain network to send and receive cryptocurrency.

### Whale
An individual or entity that holds a large amount of cryptocurrency, potentially able to influence market prices.

### Whitepaper
A document issued by a project that explains its technology, purpose, and tokenomics.

## Z

### Zero-Knowledge Proof
A cryptographic method where one party can prove to another that they know a value without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value.

### 51% Attack
A potential attack on a blockchain network where a single entity or organization controls more than 50% of the mining power, allowing them to disrupt the network by preventing new transactions or reversing recent ones.
