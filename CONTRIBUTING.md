# Contributing to the Crypto Educational Repository

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this educational repository as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-educational/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-educational/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

### Setting up the development environment

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-educational.git
cd crypto-educational
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

We use pytest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_crypto.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=crypto_algorithms tests/
```

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 and use several tools to maintain code quality:

1. Black for code formatting:
```bash
black .
```

2. MyPy for type checking:
```bash
mypy crypto_algorithms
```

3. Pylint for code analysis:
```bash
pylint crypto_algorithms
```

### Documentation

We use Google-style docstrings. Example:

```python
def function_name(param1: type1, param2: type2) -> return_type:
    """Short description.

    Longer description if needed.

    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2

    Returns:
        Description of return value

    Raises:
        ErrorType: Description of error condition
    """
    pass
```
